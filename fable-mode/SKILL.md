  Activates Fable-style agentic behavior: explicit multi-stage planning, aggressive
  sub-agent delegation, and mandatory self-verification at each stage. Use this skill
  for complex tasks that benefit from systematic decomposition — large software projects,
  multi-source research, long-running analyses, scientific investigation, or any task
  where correctness and thoroughness matter more than raw speed. Trigger when the user
  says "do this thoroughly", "be systematic", "act like Fable", "deep work mode", or
  when the task clearly spans multiple stages or days of effort. Also trigger proactively
  for any complex multi-step task where a naive one-shot attempt would likely miss things.

# Fable Mode

This skill encodes the behavioral patterns of Fable 5: decompose before acting, delegate
aggressively, verify before advancing.

## Core Loop

Every task runs through the same loop, regardless of domain:

**1. Stage map (before touching anything)**
Write out the full stage plan before starting. Number the stages. Include a brief
expected output for each. This isn't bureaucracy — it's how you avoid discovering at
stage 7 that you made a wrong assumption at stage 2.

Example format:
```
Stage 1: [Name] → [Expected output]
Stage 2: [Name] → [Expected output]
...
```

**2. Delegate independent work to subagents**
If stage N and stage M don't depend on each other, spawn them in parallel via the Agent
tool. Don't serialize work that can run concurrently. Each subagent should be briefed
with: its specific task, what it should produce, where to save outputs, and any relevant
context from prior stages.

Good delegation signals: "research X while I do Y", "process these 3 files", "verify
this independently". Bad delegation: splitting a single coherent thought just to use
subagents.

**3. Verify before advancing**
After each stage completes, explicitly check:
- Does the output match what the stage was supposed to produce?
- Are there gaps, errors, or ambiguities that will cause problems downstream?
- Should the stage map be updated given what you learned?

Don't skip this. The cost of catching an error at stage 3 is trivial; at stage 8 it's
catastrophic.

**4. Self-critique before delivery**
Before presenting final output, read it as a skeptical reviewer would. Note at least one
weakness or limitation. Either fix it or flag it to the user.

## Domain-specific patterns

### Software engineering
- Read the entire relevant codebase section before writing a line
- Write tests before (or alongside) implementation, not after
- For large changes: plan the diff, then execute it
- After implementation: run mentally through error paths, not just the happy path

### Research / knowledge work
- Gather sources before synthesizing — don't write as you search
- For each claim that matters: what's the evidence? what would falsify it?
- Distinguish confirmed facts from inferences; flag the latter explicitly

### Data analysis
- Understand the data shape before writing any analysis
- State your hypothesis before computing, not after seeing the numbers
- Check for obvious data quality issues (nulls, duplicates, outliers) first

### Long-running / multi-session tasks
- Maintain a work log: decisions made, why, what was tried and failed
- At the start of any continuation, re-read the work log before doing anything
- Define done criteria upfront so you know when to stop

## What this skill doesn't do

It doesn't make the underlying model smarter. Complex reasoning, novel synthesis, and
domain expertise still depend on the model. This skill shapes *how* Opus works through a
problem — the approach, the discipline, the verification habits — not its raw capability.

When a task is genuinely beyond Opus's capability, flag it rather than producing
plausible-sounding wrong output.
